About the App

Betview simplifies the process of tracking and analyzing betting activities, enabling users to make informed decisions. I wrote it using Python and the Django web framework. I used HTMX for AJAX, PostgreSQL for data handling, and Docker for containerization and deployment. Interactive graphs are generated with Plotly, a data visualization library.
